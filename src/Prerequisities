Program to count number of words and character that a user inputs until the word 'Stop' is written.

* Count number of words written, or rows.
* Count number of characters that has been written.
* The program should shutdown when the user inputs 'Stop'. The word itself should not be accounted for.
* The program itself should contain two classes.
* One class to take in text and to type out text to the user.
* One class to count the words and characters.
* The control to keep track if the user has inputted the word 'Stop' can be done in any of the classes.
* The program should write out the words that has been inputted with a blankspace between the words.
* The program should showcase the longest word that has been inputted. In case of it having multiple words that are the same length, only the first one will show.
* The control of which the user has typed 'Stop' or not, must be in the logic-class.

The program should be tested automatically with atleast three (3) different test cases.
The test cases should be written in Junit.

The test cases should cover these cases:
* testAppShutsDownWhenUserTypesStop             -The program should stop when the word 'Stop' is inputted.
* testAppCountsEveryWordExcludingStop           -The program should count each word/row excluding the word 'Stop'.
* testAppOnlyCountLetters                       -The program should count each character.
* testAppWritesOutLongestWord                   -The program should write out the longest word that has been typed out.
* testAppWritesOnlyValidWords                   -The program should write out only the first longest word.
* testAppWritesOutEveryWordWithBlankspace       -The program should write out each and every word with a blankspace between each word.
